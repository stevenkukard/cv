My journey has taken me from music, to finance, to data science. I've kept a foot in the music world, taking on the occasional composition project.

<!-- After completing my undergraduate degree in music, I spent a year working as a freelance composer and music producer. I then moved into finance, working as a quantitative analyst for a hedge fund. I spent 5 years in finance, completing my CFA 1 and honours degree in statistics. I then moved into data science, working as a data scientist for a large South African retailer. I've been working as a data scientist for the past 3 years. -->
