## Approach

### Back end
These days I deploy serverless processes that communicate with each other via HTTP endpoints. Soon, I hope to begin integrating AI/LLM workers into this architecture. 

### Front end
I mainly use Python and R UI frameworks (Streamlit, Dash, Shiny) running in containers on the cloud.
